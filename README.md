## This Project is built using :
* Android, Kotlin
* Jetpack Compose
* Clean Architecture (MVVM + Usecases)
* Dependency Injections HILT
* Coroutines
* Custom AppLogger.
* and TOML for central dependencies management.

  And As we progress we can enhance it further, Project is scalable based on the architecture and approach used,
  all setups are ready and Porject can be used as its to enhance and build other feature going forward.
  <br/>&
  We can integrate analytics crashlytics, and scale it futher with implementation of other features.
